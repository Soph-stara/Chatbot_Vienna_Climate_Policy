    "# A Chatbot for the Climate Policy of Vienna #\n",
    "With this Capstone Project, I have build a Large Language Model out of the key climate policy documents of Vienna since the Introduction of the Climate Protection Policy in 1999.\n",
    "The Climate Protection Policies 1 and 2 (KliP 1 & 2 - short for Klimaschutzprogramme, you can find more information here: https://www.wien.gv.at/umwelt/programm-klip) were introduced in 1999 and ran until 2021. \n",
    "In 2020, the coalition government (ÖVP & the Green Party) announced the commitment to achieving climate neutrality by 2040 and shortly after this, in 2022, the Vienna Climate Roadmap (https://www.wien.gv.at/spezial/klimafahrplan/) was introduced. \n",
    "With these 4 documents, spanning approximately 700 pages, a Chatbot was created. "
